                                 Everyone, hello! ... Have you been ignored before  How would it make you feel? Do all rejections cause the same amount of pain? What exactly did the rejection mean? 
                                 <br><br>
                                 Rejection is a single word. However, different people experience and interpret it differently. Rejection meant different things to different people. Regardless of how different the rejections are, they all cause the same amount of pain.This pain cannot be expressed in words. If all this rejection does is hurt us? Definitely not!!. They also give people emotions such as fear, anger, reluctance, hatred, jealousy, and disability. I won't be able to tell you whether this reaction affects everyone the same way. But I am assured that you will never be the same after my rejection. Yes! After my first rejection, I am not the same person.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <p>Is rejection a breakup that always ends badly? But, some rejection can also cause little breakdowns within you. So let's move on to some new stuff. Have you ever fallen infatuated with someone? Or do you already have one? In general, everyone has gone through this experience. Some of you who claim, "I never had a crush until now," It meant you are not an exceptional person to this sensation; it actually meant you may fall into this category in the coming days or the feeling you had inside your heart is regrettably not exposed by you.
                                 <br>
                                 <br>
                                 Have you ever communicated these feelings to the people who should have them? NO, most of us doesnâ€™t.Because we're afraid of losing them, we won't say it out loud. Some of you have spoken about it to them and had fruitful relationships. You have my respect for your courage. This does not imply that the boldest people are those who communicate their emotions. I can say with certainty that it hurt to keep the emotion inside of you, and that it hurt even more than to be rejected. Please convey this kind of feeling to the person who deserves it since it is precious.

                              <br>
                            <p>The emotion of rejection can also be expressed as regret. Is it simple to identify others' regertness? absolutely not! Regret is a feeling that is not always publicly expressed. To be honest, some of us basically regret every action we take in our daily lives. Do you feel bad about not responding someone? And I did it. how it feels to them as you walk next to them without respond anything. Although you may have valid reasons for doing this, your actions will change how they feel about you. Please don't judge them based on this if you feel bad about their response. They might not have been aware of your presence or not know where to begin. Feel free to start a conversation. Along these lines, express your emotions to others in a direct manner. By doing so, you might be able to heal them or inspire new feelings towards them in you.</p>

                                 Rejection is one of the most painful emotions you can experience. It truly feels like a punch to the abdomen. Regardless of how successful someone appears to be, we've all been there at some point in our lives. It never feels good, whether in the workplace or in our personal lives, and we don't always know how to deal with it. 
                                 <br><br>
                                 Rejection is a single word. However, different people experience and interpret it differently. For some, it was when a loved one broke their heart. When someone was not chosen for his dream job, he felt rejected. When their work was not well received by others, it meant rejection for them. When someone's worth was unknown to them, it meant rejection,.... In this way, rejection meant different things to different people. Regardless of how different the rejections are, they all cause the same amount of pain.

                              <p>I'm referring to the actual pain of rejection. I once read in an article that our human brain cannot differentiate between physical and mental pain. To be clear, our brain reacts in the same way when our hand or heart breaks. This pain cannot be expressed in words. If all this rejection does is hurt us? Definitely not!!. They also give people emotions such as fear, anger, reluctance, hatred, jealousy, and disability. I won't be able to tell you whether this reaction affects everyone the same way. But I am assured that you will never be the same after my rejection. Yes! After my first rejection, I am not the same person.

                                 Basically, rejection does not cause us all that much pain. Being rejected by society, on the other hand, is a much more difficult and painful experience. The agony of rejection will grow as we and our surroundings mature. In general, everyone reacts fearfully to the story of  rejection of them. Those who fail their interviews are concerned that they will lose their jobs. Those who fail in relationships have the fear of choosing a partner better than them. It is extremely difficult for any man to accept a no from others. It has a variety of effects. For example, if we throw a stone into the sea, we can't see how far it travels deep. We can't tell how much a rejection hurts us in this way.

                                 <u> How to deal with it:</u> 
                                <li><p><u>Validate your feelings:</u> We rarely validate our feelings, and we frequently act as if others do. The more open you are to rejection, the more you will learn from it.</li></p>
                                <li><p> <u>Consider the positive side of rejection: </u> Hearing a no can sometimes lead us to the correct yes.</li></p>
                                <li><p> <u>Quit taking rejection personally, and stop allowing others to determine your worth:</u>  It's never about rejection,it's always about you. It's sometimes all about the person who rejected you and their choices. If the rejection of others destroys you, it indicates you have given them and their opinions the power to break you and your spirit.</li></p>
                                <li><p> <u>We must overcome the distress caused by rejection:</u>  As I previously indicated, we will never be the same person after rejection, but we will learn to be in the proper way most of the time.</li></p>
